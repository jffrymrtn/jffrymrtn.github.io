Temaki was the first Android app I made, just 3 years ago after an internship as an Android Developer.
Temaki is a simple lists app that allows users to make lists for anything - groceries, to-do lists, and more.

Over the app's development time, it has received over 2000 downloads and was maintained for 3 months. You can still view
the accompanying marketing website, coded with my obviously early-knowledge of web development: [http://jffry-mrtn.github.io/temaki/](http://jffry-mrtn.github.io/temaki/).

The app wasn't the best designed lists app. Ever. But it still holds some sentimental value as the first thing I've published online.

Although it's no longer being maintained, you can view the source code on Github: [Source code](https://github.com/jffry-mrtn/temaki)

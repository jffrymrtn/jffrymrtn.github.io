## Overview

Kaku is a minimalist Writing Prompts app I wrote for the iPhone. The app is
straightforward and designed to get users to write as soon as possible.

The app was built over 1 month using Swift and is [open sourced on GitHub](https://github.com/jffrymrtn/kaku).

The home page of the app displays a daily Writing Prompt, and a Call-To-Action button draws the user to
write.

Choosing to write brings to user to a blank canvas.

The writing experience is simple and not convoluted. The app is designed to let the
user focus on what they're writing relative to what the daily prompt is, which is
always displayed at the top of the screen.

Users always have an archive of all daily prompts that they have written something for.
This is crucial for a Writing Prompts app, where inspiration, creativity, and consistency is key.

Although the app was not published on the App Store, it's one of my earlier iOS apps, and serves as a
practice in design, UX, and Swift.

## Overview

Writeily is a Markdown text editor app for Android that I developed and designed extensively. I have maintained the project for 1 year on Github.

I designed Writeily with Google's Material Design in mind - a minimal but colourful theme, and a floating action button to highlight the app's primary function: creating notes. The minimal design is meant to stay out of the way and avoid cluttering the UI with unnecessary elements that detract from the writing and viewing experience.

The app currently has over 12,000 downloads on Google Play, and holds a 4.2-star rating.

Recently, I handed a spin-off of Writeily, called Writeily Pro, off to a loyal contributor, who now fully maintains and owns the app while I tackle on new projects.

Writeily is no oonger on the Play Store but you can view the source code [on Github](https://github.com/jffry-mrtn/writeily)

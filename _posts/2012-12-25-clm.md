CLM Event Services is a website I developed for an audience interested in servicing an Event Manager. I built the first version of the website on December 2012, and re-built it on a re-design on December 2013. I continue to
maintain the site today.

The website is a straightforward and based on ease of navigation. Hero images are used on every page to extend the identity of events across the website.

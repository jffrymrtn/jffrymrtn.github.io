Bernabe Dentistry is a website I developed for the Bernabe Dentistry offices in Toronto, Canada. The website was designed and developed in just over 1 month.

The website is designed to be a straightforward, single-page, column containing of only the necessary information a visitor might want to know about the dentistry office. The focus was on location, contact, and services that were offered.

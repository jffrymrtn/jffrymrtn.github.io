Eventii is a website I designed and developed with a small team of three from April 2014 to August 2014. The website was a listing of local events around Toronto, Canada.

Eventii was designed to focus on imagery as a tool for attracting the audience. There's a sidebar for quick-access information about each event - showing what's most important to the user.

While the website is no longer being maintained, you can find screenshots of the functionality below.

## Overview

Kivvi is an Android app I built with a friend over 3 days during the CODE (Canadian Open Data Experience) Hackathon.

The app utilizes nutritional datasets from the Canadian Open Data Set, and calculates the amount of nutritions the user gets after inputting or scanning a food item. The design-focused app is minimal and displays information in the most basic way.

Although the app was not released on Google Play, the source code is on Github (free for anyone to compile and install).

Focus is an Android app concept I designed for setting and accomplishing single-goal tasks each day.

The premise of the app was to focus on minimalism, and using colour to identify the status of a task. A grey background would mean a task is unfinished and ongoing, a green background would indicate a finished task. And red would be a warning to the user as they reach the end of the day and haven't finished their task yet.

I designed the interface to be mainly typographic - only showing what was necessary: the task and the date of the task.

Viewing past successes (or failures) is necessary, so the archive of tasks is a simple list.

 Each item is identified by colour indicating whether they were completed or not.

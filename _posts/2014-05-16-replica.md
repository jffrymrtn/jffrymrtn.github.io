Replica is a simple iOS app concept I made in February 2014. The basis of the app is: _A simple way to log your day as it happens, synced to Dropbox, and shareable on Twitter_. The concept for the app was born out of the idea to re-think mobile blogging. Realizing that blogs are a great way to log your day, I designed a timeline-like interface of logged events.

- The timeline-like interface was meant to look very much like a Twitter feed. You could swipe on the status bar to switch between days, and enter events from a textbox at the bottom.
- Each "log" is shareable, so I put a hypothetical 140-character limit on each log - meaning users could easily share their logs on Twitter.
- Swipe-able list items were a thing in the early months of iOS 7, so I incorporated the gesture here as well. A swipe to the left allowed the user to share the respective log via Twitter.
- By convention of other iOS apps (ie. Mail.app), a swipe from the right deletes a log.

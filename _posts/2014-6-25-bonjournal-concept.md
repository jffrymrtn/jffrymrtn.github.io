[Bonjournal](http://bonjourn.al/) is a beautifully minimal travel journal website where you can blog about your adventures. This is an unofficial mockup and concept for an Android app.

- The app has a lot of white space, but places an emphasis on **photography**, as that was what I felt a travel journal should highlight.
- The accents of grey help give a sense of depth and continuity with tab bars, and the floating, circular, "+" button highlights the main action of adding journal entries.
- Clicking on a story opens a separate screen. This is where the grey accent comes most into play. On a stream posts in the story, the background colour alternates from white to a very light grey to help with direction.

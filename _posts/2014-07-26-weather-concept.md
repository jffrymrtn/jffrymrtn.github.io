## The Idea

What's the Weather is a prototype I designed and developed to display a fun, quick, minimal, visualization of the weather.

- On load, the page is off-white, a blank slate.
- The only real information on the page is the temperature in Celsius, which is shown after the user enters a location.
- The current weather is shown as a __colour__. The background changes to yellow if it's sunny outside. Blue if it's raining, and grey if it's cloudy.
- The background colour transitions over a gradual fading effect. I thought it was a fun and colourful way to display weather.

The web page is live and working, but has one quirk: only some cities work (sorry to cities that don't work!).

For best results, try these:
- Toronto

- Seoul

- Tokyo

- Ottawa

- Vancouver

- New York

- Hong Kong
